## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

## How to  run it locally
- Fork the repo
- Clone the repo
- Run this command on the terminal
```git
git clone (URL of cloned repo)
```
- Play around with the code ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥


### What I learned

### Git commands I learnt through out the process

```git
git log
```
```git
git -D branch newBranchname
```
```git
git checkout branchname
```
```git
git merge branchname
```
```git
git push origin -u branchname
```
```git
git push origin -delete branchname
```
```git
git branch -d branchname
```
```git
git commit -m "commit message"
```
```git
git push origin -u remotebranchname
```
```git
git pull
```

### Continued development

I will focused on learning CSS Grid later after the project completion. I was finding it difficult making the design responsive on mobile with flex-box;


### Useful resources

- [Github Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en) - This helped me for understanding github. I really liked this documentations, it very beginner friendly and I use it a lot.
- [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-delete-a-git-branch-both-locally-and-remotely/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to delete branch both locally and remotely. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning Git and Github.
- If you want more help with writing markdown, I recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.
